## 🎯 The Big Problem

Building a website from scratch takes hours of repetitive boilerplate coding. Developers waste time setting up navbars, hero sections, responsiveness, and layout.  
Existing AI tools offer speed but take away creative control. On the other hand, pure manual design is time-consuming and requires deep expertise.

## 🚀 The B2 Hybrid Solution

This project provides **two independent, professional-grade paths** to website creation under one roof:

### 1. 🤖 AI-Powered Engine (for Speed)

- **Text-to-Website:** Converts prompts like *"A cyberpunk portfolio"* into valid HTML/CSS.
- **Neural Image Generation:** Automatically generates context-aware images via Pollinations AI.
- **Smart UI Core:** Includes a responsive sidebar, real-time layer visualization, and mobile preview.
- **Clean Export:** One-click export to a standalone `index.html` file ready for deployment.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.13 + Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API + Flask + TailwindCSS

---

### 2. ✍️ Manual High-Precision Studio (for Quality & Full Control)

This version is **completely standalone** – no Python, no API key, no installation.  
Built with **the best materials** (pure HTML, CSS, Tailwind, vanilla JavaScript) and includes:

- ⚡ **Zero Setup:** Just double-click the file – runs in any browser.
- 🛠️ **Drag & Drop Visual Editor:** Move sections, change themes, edit content visually.
- 💾 **Auto-Save to Local Storage:** Never lose your work.
- 🎨 **Professional Preset Themes:** Modern, Cyberpunk, Retro, Corporate.
- 🏆 **Why it's better than AI?** Because it's crafted with high precision and full manual control – often producing a more refined and usable output than the AI version.

| API key required | Yes (from Google) | No |
| Generation speed | High (seconds) | Depends on user skill |
| Control over details | Medium | Absolute |
| Final output quality | Good | Excellent (if user is skilled) |
| Best for | Quick start, prototyping | Final production projects |
