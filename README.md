## 🛑 The Problem
Building a website structure from scratch takes hours of boilerplate coding. Developers waste time setting up navbars, hero sections, and responsiveness.

## 🚀 The B2 Solution
**B2 Studio** is a Generative UI Engine. You describe the vision, and the AI writes the code, designs the layout, selects the color palette, and even generates placeholder images via generic prompts.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Text-to-Website:** Converts prompts like *"A cyberpunk portfolio"* into valid HTML/CSS.
- **Neural Image Generation:** Automatically generates context-aware images via Pollinations AI.
- **Smart UI Core:** Includes a responsive sidebar, real-time layer visualization, and mobile preview.
- **Clean Export:** One-click export to a standalone `index.html` file ready for deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core Logic:** Python 3.13
- **AI Backend:** Google Gemini API (Flash Model)
- **Server:** Flask (Localhost Microservice)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS + TailwindCSS (No node_modules required!)
